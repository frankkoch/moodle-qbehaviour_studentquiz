# StudentQuiz

The StudentQuiz Question Behaviour extends the immediate feedback question behaviour and
allows you to rate and comment question after the user checked the answer for grading.

Students like preparatory questions for exams. However, it’s hard
to provide a large quantity of questions for all the self-assessments
and exams. That’s why the University of Applied Sciences Rapperswil
developed the Moodle plugin StudentQuiz. StudentQuiz enables students
to collaboratively create their own question pools within Moodle.
Even if an individual student contributes just a few questions, a large
cohort could easily build up an extensive question pool.

In StudentQuiz, students can filter questions into quizzes, and they
can rate and comment on questions while working through the quizzes.
StudentQuiz collects usage data, and assigns points to students for
creating questions and giving right answers. The created questions
become part of the Moodle question bank and can be reused in other
Moodle quizzes.

We hope that StudentQuiz finds your interest.
