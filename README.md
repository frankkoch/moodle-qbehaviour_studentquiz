# moodle-qbehaviour_studentquiz

The studentquiz question behaviour extends the immediate feedback question behaviour. 
In addition to the immediate feedback the studentquiz behaviour allows you to rate 
and comment on questions in quizzes. After the immediate feedback of a question
the behaviour shows the rating using stars and user comments. The users have to rate the questions answered and 
can add a comment.
